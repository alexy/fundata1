SUN FIRE X4240 X64 SERVER: 

2X AMD	1 OPTERON MODEL 2384 (2.7GHZ/512KB) QUAD CORE PROCESSOR, 
4X 2GB DDR2-667 SINGLE RANK MEMORY, 
4X 146GB HDD, 
HBA RAID CARD, DVD-RW, 2X PSU, 
HT BRIDGE CARD, SERVICE PROCESSOR

6 73GB 15K RPM 2.5" SAS DISK DRIVE WITH 1 BRACKET. ROHS-6. X-OPTION.

The total RAM is 64 GB, there're very fast 15K RPM SAS drivers on which we store the data and swap, and slower drivers for data processing.

We run CentOS 5 (RHEL 5), but I also installed [Gentoo Prefix](http://www.gentoo.org/proj/en/gentoo-alt/prefix/), so if an implementation's language and libraries are in either of them, it will be easy to run.
